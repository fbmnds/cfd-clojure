## How to run the tests

The project uses [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje/).

`lein midje` will run all tests and generate graphics/animation.

This assumes a valid Gnu environment in place. For Windows, [GoW](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki) is recommended.

`lein midje :filter -mpeg` will run all tests without generation graphics/animation. The tests support further filtering ([Midje filters])(https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Using-metadata-to-filter-facts#lein-midje-command-line-arguments) by using `:step1 ...`.
